DSG = Data Science G(I leave you to guess what G means :smile:)\r\n\r\nStuff means ipython notebooks explaining concepts, having codes for various algorithms, and data science problems.\r\n\r\nAlso note that there might be errors so read at your risk :smile: and suggest me corrections.\r\n\r\nI hope you find this useful in your data science journey. All the best !!!\r\n\r\nLet us all become DATA SCIENCE GODS :innocent:\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n## Ipython Notebooks\r\n\r\n[Evaluating Classifiers](https://github.com/ankitom/DSG/blob/master/Evaluating%20Classifiers%20.ipynb)\r\n\r\n[Comparing Models](https://github.com/ankitom/DSG/blob/master/Comparing%20models.ipynb)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### New notebook coming tomorrow :smile:",

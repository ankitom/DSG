This repository contains my stuff related to Data Science. DSG = Data Science G(I leave G to your imagination :smile:)

Stuff means ipython notebooks explaining concepts, having codes for various algorithms, and data science problems.

Also note that there might be errors so read at your risk :smile: and suggest me corrections.

I hope you find this useful in your data science journey. All the best !!!

Let us all become DATA SCIENCE GODS :innocent:

# DSG

This repository contains my stuff related to Data Science. DSG = Data Science G(I leave you to guess what G means :))

Stuff means ipython notebooks explaining concepts, having codes for various algorithms, and data science problems. 

Also note that there might be errors so read at your risk :) and suggest me corrections. 

I hope you find this useful in your data science journey. All the best !!! 

Let us all become DATA SCIENCE GODS :)
